## Jules Blom

I studied geoscience engineering, which involves interpreting complex subsurface data. There, I grew frustrated with the software we used.
I came to believe that

1. Software should be useful and usable, even technical software.
2. A good visualization can make complex ideas clear quickly.

These beliefs pushed me to learn programming, specifically frontend development to build more thoughtful interfaces to display technical information.

For the past five years, I've worked on data-rich applications across various domains, focusing on turning abstract numbers into visual insights.

At the moment, my primary interest is figuring out how to close the gap between the fragmented tools that exist for working with geotechnical data and the more accessible, interoperable tools that I believe could exist.

Please reach out if you're interested in chatting about ideas.

## Availability

I'm available for freelance projects, preferably involving data-rich technical applications. With experience building visualization tools across various domains, I specialize in making complex information accessible through thoughtfully designed interfaces. If you're looking for help with geospatial data visualization, interactive technical tools, or frontend development for specialized domains, let's discuss how I can contribute to your project.

My journey started in the world of geoscience engineering, where I spent years working with complex data and often frustrating software. Like many engineers, I found myself thinking: "There has to be a better way to visualize this."

This frustration sparked my transition to frontend development. I realized that well-designed interfaces and thoughtful data visualizations could transform how engineers interpret and use complex datasets. The geological structures, material properties, and spatial relationships that are so crucial in geotechnical work shouldn't be obscured by poor tools – they should be illuminated by them.

For the past five years, I've built data-intensive applications across various domains, from optimizing maritime operations to visualizing engineering designs. Each project reinforced my belief in the power of making complex data tangible and actionable.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of data visualization, geospatial tools, and web technologies. There's something magical about translating abstract numbers into intuitive visual forms that reveal patterns and insights that would otherwise remain hidden.

With this project, I'm returning to my geoscience roots, but with new tools and perspectives. I believe we can bridge the gap between the powerful geotechnical tools that exist today and the more accessible, interoperable tools that could exist tomorrow. By connecting site investigation data with modern visualization capabilities, we can help engineers make better decisions and ultimately build safer, more efficient infrastructure.
