I studied geoscience engineering, which involves interpreting complex subsurface data. There, I grew frustrated with the software we used.
I came to believe that

1. Software should be useful and usable, even technical software.
2. A good visualization can make complex ideas clear quickly.

These beliefs pushed me to learn programming, specifically frontend development to build more thoughtful interfaces to display technical information.

For the past five years, I've worked on data-rich applications across various domains, focusing on usables UI's and turning numbers into visual insights.

At the moment, my primary interest is figuring out how to close the gap between the fragmented tools that exist for working with geotechnical data and the more accessible, interoperable tools that I believe could exist.
